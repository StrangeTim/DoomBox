Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?
The setting of api keys and rails s command was a little confusing.

Good integration testing, all 5 specs pass, however no unit testing

Do all specs pass?
yes


Is the application logic clear and easy to navigate?
Yes.


Can you make a test payment through Stripe?
Stripe works.

Mostly. The site displays properly on full screen, but breaks columns improperly when smaller.
Pictures show as link by cursor when hovered on, but do not actually link.

Are there opportunities for refactoring?
Plenty of opportunities for using ajax, but not much for refactoring.


What features stand out?
Good color scheme and pictures.

Ajax could be implemented.  When navigating to products/new a user should not be able to add products.

Addition of Twitter and Launchbox is great.
